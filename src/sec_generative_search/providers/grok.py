"""xAI Grok provider adapter.

xAI exposes an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions surface at
``https://api.x.ai/v1`` — the SDK works unchanged via a ``base_url``
override.  xAI ships no first-party embedding or reranker API, so this
module exports the chat adapter only; pair with one of the existing
embedding adapters when using Grok end-to-end.

The published catalogue uses dated slugs
(``grok-4.20-0309-reasoning``, ``grok-4-1-fast-reasoning``) rather than
moving aliases.  The dated form is preserved here because it is what
the xAI API actually accepts — a shorter alias like ``grok-4`` is not
authoritative across every endpoint and would surface as a 404 at call
time.  Reasoning vs. non-reasoning is expressed as a separate slug
(not a toggle on a single slug), matching xAI's dispatch model.
