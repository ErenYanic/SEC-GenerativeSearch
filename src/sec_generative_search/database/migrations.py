"""Forward-only SQLite schema versioning for :class:`MetadataRegistry`.

The metadata registry tracks its schema generation in a dedicated
``schema_version`` table — one row per applied version — so a database
opened by a newer build of the application can pick up unapplied
migrations on its own.  Adding a migration is a one-line append to
:data:`MIGRATIONS`; there is no decorator magic and no reflection.

The bootstrap path runs once per database open and recognises three
states:

1. **Brand-new** (no ``schema_version`` table, no ``filings`` table) —
   stamp v1 *without* running a migration body.  The idempotent
   ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` path in
   :meth:`MetadataRegistry._create_table` produces the v1 shape, so
   there is nothing for a "migration to v1" to do.
2. **v1-shaped unstamped** (``filings`` and ``task_history`` already
   exist, no ``schema_version``) — also stamp v1 without a body run.
   This is the lossless upgrade path for production / dev databases
   that pre-date this phase: row counts and column data are
   preserved exactly.
3. **Malformed unstamped** (some v1 tables missing, others present) —
   refuse with :class:`DatabaseError` naming the missing table(s).
   The operator recovery is filesystem backup + recreate, mirroring
   the rollback-out-of-scope-by-design contract that
   :class:`ReindexService` adopts for ChromaDB.

The design is **forward-only**: there are no inverse migrations.  If a
migration misbehaves, the recovery is to restore from a filesystem
backup of the SQLite file.

ChromaDB is intentionally **out of scope** for this module — the
:class:`EmbedderStamp` plus the ``_MIGRATION_FLAG`` collection metadata
already version the vector store, and the refuse-with-``sec-rag manage
reindex``-hint contract is the recovery story.  Layering a second
mechanism there would duplicate the seal.
